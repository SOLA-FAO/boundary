/**
 * Web Service Boundary class to expose methods for file streaming.
 *
 * <p>The Metro library contains a bug (see http://java.net/jira/browse/WSIT-1081) that prevents
 * file streaming over metro secured connections. Metro also consumes significant amounts of memory
 * when trying to encrypt large attachments. To avoid these bugs, this service is used unsecured and
 * does not retrieve from or update the SOLA database. Instead this service can be used to transfer
 * large files between the file systems of the client and application server. Other secured services
 * such as the Digital Archive Service, must retrieve or post files to the local file system for the
 * file streaming service.</p> <p>The service streams files directly to and from disk and has
 * minimal impact on the overall memory consumption of the application</p>
